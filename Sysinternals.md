# Tools I've used & Recommend from Sysinternals

<https://live.sysinternals.com/tools/>

Most of sysinternals either isn't something I really think I'd use, or has already been built into Windows and works great. But these are the tools I love and use frequently.

## Autologon64.exe

<https://live.sysinternals.com/tools/Autologon64.exe> Allows you to configure autologon for a user. The /accepteula flag is helpful if you're using it in a script. Though I've also just made the registry entries by hand it's not too awful.

## Bginfo64.exe

<https://live.sysinternals.com/tools/Bginfo64.exe> Shows computer information on your background (desktop wallpaper). Super handy.

## CPUSTRES64.exe

<https://live.sysinternals.com/tools/CPUSTRES64.EXE> is a CPU stress testing utility. Pretty handy.

## notmyfault64.exe

<https://live.sysinternals.com/tools/notmyfault64.exe> is a bluescreen crasher tool.

## tcpview

<https://live.sysinternals.com/tools/tcpview64.exe> lets you see what current TCP and UDP connections your computer knows of.

## whois

<https://live.sysinternals.com/tools/whois64.exe> did you know there _is_ a whois tool for Windows? They just couldn't be bothered to build it in?
